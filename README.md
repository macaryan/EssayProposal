### Title

The Future of Technology in Healthcare.




### Research Question

How can the Growth of Technology in the 21st Century help take pressure off the NHS?



### Introduction

“The NHS is part of our national story. It is part of our national myth. We think it says something important about who we are” A quote by Roger Taylor summing up the general consensus of how the nation feels about the NHS. Today the NHS is facing the biggest challenges yet in its existence. We are seeing more and more signs that the NHS is heading towards crisis point. In this essay I am going to explore the current problems the NHS faces in the 21st century and how the rapid advances in technology can not only save our ‘national treasure’ but take the system to new heights if implemented and managed correctly.


### Section 1 — History and current state of the NHS

The day the NHS was formed, 5 July 1948, one of the United Kingdom’s greatest achievements. A symbol for our country that represents what we have preserved in the past and our solidarity throughout history. When Danny Boyle orchestrated his 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony which would be there for the whole world to see, he knew he couldn’t leave out the achievement that is the NHS. To other countries, the NHS still remains too humane to be true but the question is can the NHS continue to shock the world and stay at the forefront of healthcare. Unfortunate, as it is to say, currently the NHS is under greater threat than ever. With the question constantly looming, should the NHS be privatised, it’s more important now than it’s ever been to look at how technology can aid in making sure the NHS continues to prosper and not decline.


### Section 2 — Past history of NHS and Technology

“When you think how technology has reshaped everything from the way we shop to how we communicate with friends, the lack of progress made by the NHS is astonishing. While booking holidays and doing the weekly shop online has become routine for many, making appointments to see a GP in such as way has not.” — Nick Triggle. I will be focusing on this quote and Roger Taylor’s ‘ God Bless the NHS: The Truth Behind the Current Crisis’ to learn about the NHS’s many failures since the turn of the century. Most notably was the infamous 12 billion pound NHS IT project launched in 2002 to revolutionise technology in the health service. The Public Accounts Committee concluded it the “worst and most expensive contracting fiascos” in public sector history. Over a decade later the ambitions of the project are still yet to meet and are almost totally disbanded.


### Section 3 — Current Problems

After studying the past problems of the NHS I will start to focus on the current problems.
With the NHS failing to live up to expectations we need to look at the current problems the NHS is facing in the 21st century. The inevitable pressures of our ageing population mean technology is going to have to take a greater weight in future if the Service is going to survive. Many of the diseases that have killed people in the past have been cured. People are living longer with long-term complex conditions.
Rising costs are also a huge issue for the NHS. By 2020 we could face a £30 billion funding gap. New innovative and technological breakthroughs are causing more funding. How can we design technologies which won’t be a burden to the finance of the NHS? These problems along with our lifestyle factors, longer waiting times and growing expectations of the NHS shout out for the need for intervention.

### Section 4 — Future Advancements and how do we make them work

On the bright side amongst all the NHS’ problems is that there has never been a better time to right these problems. The ‘MyHealthLondon’ article states ‘Huge advancements in medicine and surgery, alongside IT and technological innovations mean that there is a wealth of ideas and efficiencies that could potentially be implemented to bring our NHS up to modern standards to meet the needs of us all in the 21 Century.’ In this section, I will be studying these in depth and with Lyle Berkowitz’ ‘Innovation with Information Technologies in Healthcare’ along with supporting articles and case studies from Phillips Health, I will gain a better understanding of these technologies.
Innovative technologies in video and telehealth have many can be crucial in reducing hospital admissions through virtual consultation and patient education. This will then lead me to look at the importance of Self Care. Giving knowledge and power to the patient to be able to treat themselves. For many diseases, this will also include self-care devices which have already been used in England to help patients detect and monitor atrial fibrillation which is only one example. The NHS Chief Executive Stevens stated in a Guardian article that we should “grab with both hands” the growing opportunities technology offers both to help promote health and tackle the service’s chronic financial problems by saving on treatment and rehabilitation costs.
We cannot forget to undermine the positive impact that Information Technology can have on the NHS if implemented correctly. It has the power to give patients more power over their health as well as reducing the cost and improving the quality of services. With guidance from the ‘Personalised health and care 2020: a framework for action’ plan I can look into the possibilities of this being a major factor in the resurgence of the service.
Utilising these new approaches within a major restructure the NHS could go on to be a reassuring source of healthcare and wellbeing, as well as an inspirational model of good working practice for years to come.


### Conclusion

In hind site, for these technologies to work and be implemented successfully, we need NHS administrators to push for these solutions. The pressure on the service will only increase if we don’t take advantage now. Phillips Health sums it up brilliantly in their ‘future of health’ article, ‘Healthcare is a study in contrasts. On the one hand, it is rich with innovation, brilliant clinicians, world-class research, cutting-edge technology, and sophisticated health systems that provide care for some of the most challenging conditions and procedures. On the other hand, complexity in the financing, regulation and delivery of care counteracts these considerable strengths to some degree.’ We need to find a way of outweighing the balance of the bad hand if we want to see the NHS succeed in the future.
